# Images in the repo that are built FROM other images in the repo are built
# from the special tag `unlabelled'. This is vestigial from the old approach:
#     LABEL (from `docker build --label`) data creates a new
#     layer in the image. Without building from the `unlabelled' tag, all direct or
#     indirect child images have to be fully rebuilt when the LABEL data changes.
#     Since we include the git hash in the LABEL data, this changes frequently.
#
#     We take the approach of building the :latest tag first, then finding the
#     parent of the layer containing the LABEL information, and tagging that as
#     :unlabelled. This works because all of the LABEL information applied via a
#     --label option(s) to `docker build' is put in a single layer at the top of
#     the resulting stack of layers.
#
# However
# - the above no longer worked, because `docker build --label` does not currently
#   result with a separate layer that could be used for tagging.
# - the history is retained above as an explanation what the ":unlabelled" was
#   supposed to mean.
# - TODO replace :unlabelled with something more appropriate.
