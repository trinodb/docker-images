# FILE NAME: gpinitsystem_singlenode

# A configuration file is needed by the gpinitsystem utility.
# This sample file initializes a Greenplum Database Single Node
# Edition (SNE) system with one master and  two segment instances
# on the local host. This file is referenced when you run gpinitsystem.

# REQUIRED PARAMETERS
################################################

# A name for the array you are configuring. You can use any name you
# like. Enclose the name in quotes if the name contains spaces.

ARRAY_NAME="GPDB SINGLENODE"


# This specifies the file that contains the list of segment host names
# that comprise the Greenplum system. For a single-node system, this
# file contains the local OS-configured hostname (as output by the
# hostname command). If the file does not reside in the same
# directory where the gpinitsystem utility is executed, specify
# the absolute path to the file.

MACHINE_LIST_FILE=/home/gpadmin/gpdb-hosts


# This specifies a prefix that will be used to name the data directories
# of the master and segment instances. The naming convention for data
# directories in a Greenplum Database system is SEG_PREFIX<number>
# where <number> starts with 0 for segment instances and the master
# is always -1. So for example, if you choose the prefix gpsne, your
# master instance data directory would be named gpsne-1, and the segment
# instances would be named gpsne0, gpsne1, gpsne2, gpsne3, and so on.

SEG_PREFIX=gpsne


# Base port number on which primary segment instances will be
# started on a segment host. The base port number will be
# incremented by one for each segment instance started on a host.

PORT_BASE=40000


# This specifies the data storage location(s) where the script will
# create the primary segment data directories. The script creates a
# unique data directory for each segment instance. If you want multiple
# segment instances per host, list a data storage area for each primary
# segment you want created. The recommended number is one primary segment
# per CPU. It is OK to list the same data storage area multiple times
# if you want your data directories created in the same location. The
# number of data directory locations specified will determine the number
# of primary segment instances created per host.
# You must make sure that the user who runs gpinitsystem (for example,
# the gpadmin user) has permissions to write to these directories. You
# may want to create these directories on the segment hosts before running
# gpinitsystem and chown them to the appropriate user.

declare -a DATA_DIRECTORY=(/gpdata1 /gpdata2)


# The OS-configured hostname of the Greenplum Database master instance.

MASTER_HOSTNAME=localhost


# The location where the data directory will be created on the
# Greenplum master host.
# You must make sure that the user who runs gpinitsystem
# has permissions to write to this directory. You may want to
# create this directory on the master host before running
# gpinitsystem and chown it to the appropriate user.

MASTER_DIRECTORY=/gpmaster


# The port number for the master instance. This is the port number
# that users and client connections will use when accessing the
# Greenplum Database system.

MASTER_PORT=5432


# The shell the gpinitsystem script uses to execute
# commands on remote hosts. Allowed value is ssh. You must set up
# your trusted host environment before running the gpinitsystem
# script. You can use gpssh-exkeys to do this.

TRUSTED_SHELL=ssh


# Maximum distance between automatic write ahead log (WAL)
# checkpoints, in log file segments (each segment is normally 16
# megabytes). This will set the checkpoint_segments parameter
# in the postgresql.conf file for each segment instance in the
# Greenplum Database system.

CHECK_POINT_SEGMENTS=8


# The character set encoding to use. Greenplum supports the
# same character sets as PostgreSQL. See 'Character Set Support'
# in the PostgreSQL documentation for allowed character sets.
# Should correspond to the OS locale specified with the
# gpinitsystem -n option.

ENCODING=UNICODE

# Optional. Uncomment to create a database of this name after the

# the CREATE DATABASE command or the createdb script.
